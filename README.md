In this challenge, I performed database queries with TypeORM in three ways:

- Using ORM
- Using Query Builder
- Using Raw Query

This helped me to understand and exercise the different types of queries we can do.

The application has two modules: `users` and `games`. A **user** can have several games and the same **game** can be associated with several users.
